00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,120
Hello! Arkadiusz ‘Arkadikuss’ Woźniak here!

2
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,300
In this material we will explain to you

3
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,100
how exactly the SoulFire team works

4
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,080
and how The History of Khorinis is being produced.

5
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,040
The video was created as a response

6
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,820
to your questions about the process of creating and managing the project.

7
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,960
You really inspired us,

8
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,640
for what we are very grateful!

9
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,780
In this material we will explain to you

10
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,360
how we manage our work in each division of the project:

11
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,300
The Game Development Division, responsible for the production of The History of Khorinis,

12
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,740
The Video Division, which presents you video materials connected with the mod

13
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,160
and manages our YouTube channel,

14
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,260
and, last but not least, The Dubbing Division, which focuses on sound production.

15
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,020
At times our explanations may be simplistic,

16
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,100
but our main goal is to make sure

17
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,680
that EVERYTHING is clearly understood

18
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,060
by EVERY PERSON watching the video.

19
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,260
And now, with all that said,

20
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,160
let us begin!

21
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,460
First, we must point out

22
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,120
that The Game Development Division and The Video Division

23
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,360
are two SEPARATE subgroups of one team,

24
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,660
with very different tasks and goals.

25
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:44,900
As far as their work is concerned, they are not even slightly connected to one another.

26
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,340
Let us put it this way:

27
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,980
meet Szymon and Mateusz.

28
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,160
Szymon is a programmer

29
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,820
and Mateusz knows how to edit videos.

30
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,620
Since their skills are different, it makes no sense

31
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,140
to force Mateusz to develop the game modification

32
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,240
and Szymon to work on video editing.

33
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,000
Still, both The Game Development and The Video Divisions are united under the banner of the SoulFire team.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,720
Each division supports the team in its own, unique way:

35
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,800
The Game Development Division produces the game, while The Video Division creates video materials connected with the project.

36
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,560
Since we still receive many questions regarding this matter

37
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,640
we decided to clearly explain the pattern of our work in this video.

38
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,700
Going through the comment sections of our social media accounts, we have noticed

39
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,560
that some of you are curious about the reason why we are making documentaries about elderly actors.

40
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,280
We need to remind you that all these actors

41
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,440
help us entirely FOR FREE and OUT OF THEIR KINDNESS!

42
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,960
Please understand that we could have asked them to only dub the mod, but that’s not what we want.

43
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,980
We want to honour their hard work in a form of these documentaries,

44
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,880
and we wish to do so in their lifetime.

45
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,740
The fact that they help us with dubbing is just an additional gesture of their kindness.

46
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,600
Our intentions are 100% pure,

47
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,240
and you cannot expect us to objectify these magnificent actors.

48
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,160
Moreover, we remind you that The History of Khorinis is a non-profit project

49
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,780
and we cannot afford to pay the dubbing actors.

50
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,440
It's worth mentioning that some of the elders, for example Mr Tomecki,

51
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,520
no longer dub computer games.

52
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,780
He honestly admitted

53
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,380
that he's been rejecting every commercial dubbing proposal

54
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,560
for a number of years now.

55
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,040
We realise, of course, that some people might not enjoy videos like these,

56
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,200
and are interested only in playing The History of Khorinis.

57
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,160
Whichever point of view you hold, please understand

58
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,580
that these videos and our work on them give you the opportunity to play the game with an amazing dubbing,

59
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,320
which will only improve the gameplay and your in-game experience.

60
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:56,880
That's why we ask for your consideration and respect for that part of the filming and dubbing work of our team.

61
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,420
Video clips are being created also at your requests,

62
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,180
and as long as you want and enjoy them,

63
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,880
their production does make sense.

64
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,180
Division of labour

65
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,680
The work on The History of Khorinis is governed by the team leader,

66
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,360
who handles the project's consistency and its artistic management in The Game Development Division,

67
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:21,200
and supervises the process of direction of The Video and The Dubbing Divisions.

68
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,060
Now, as promised, we will cover each of the team’s sections in more detail.

69
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,020
The Game Development Division

70
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,080
The Game Development Division is split into several subdivisions:

71
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,920
programmers, screenwriters,

72
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,020
graphic designers and level designers.

73
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,280
Each of them is run by different coordinators,

74
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,820
who lead and organize work only in their subdivision of the team.

75
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,480
Once, when the SoulFire team consisted of just a handful of people, the working order was as follows,

76
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,460
and the team leader coordinated everyone's work directly.

77
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,600
But, as the project grew in size,

78
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,400
the number of team members multiplied,

79
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,020
and other issues appeared, such as video materials and dubbing.

80
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,360
The system of coordinators proved to be more efficient and we apply this method ever since.

81
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,280
The coordinators are what keeps the project running,

82
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:14,440
and the pace of our work depends on the way they manage the division of tasks among other team members.

83
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,900
Frequently, there are so many assignments to distribute

84
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,000
that this task takes most of the time they commit to the project.

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,920
The coordinators' duty is also

86
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,300
to bring together all of the parts submitted by the team members,

87
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,380
and to cooperate with the coordinators of other subgroups of The Game Development Division.

88
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,700
The coordinators work almost full time.

89
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,960
Managing such a big team

90
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,440
requires them to be always available,

91
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,000
at least through a phone communicator.

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,340
Their accessibility is crucial in situations

93
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:55,000
when someone needs information concerning an issue from a specific division

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,940
or when new tasks have to be distributed among the team members.

95
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,380
The latter, on the other hand,

96
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,060
work only in their free time.

97
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,980
The assembling of the project's files is possible due to the version control system Git,

98
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,620
which is a popular tool used for internet projects.

99
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,000
It allows all team members - programmers, graphic designers and screenwriters -

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,500
to upload files to the collective repository.

101
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,700
Everything is organised into folders and categories.

102
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,120
The task of putting all the files together, then,

103
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,780
does not rest on the shoulders of only one person.

104
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:32,160
What is more, the coordinator of programmers created a special tool which allows to piece the game together.

105
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,660
Each team member who downloaded the program

106
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,960
can access updates to The History of Khorinis at any moment

107
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,260
and play the most recent version of the game,

108
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:49,040
even if the files were modified only minutes earlier.

109
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,340
The entire system is indeed revolutionary.

110
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,740
So far, the only Gothic mod which used a similar tool made solely for the purposes of the project

111
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,520
made solely for the purposes of the project, was Gothic: Reloaded Mod -

112
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,000
only the tool was slightly simpler.

113
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,520
The idea for the tool was based on internal builds of some gamedev studios

114
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,320
and, to be frank, it's only thanks to this tool that we are able to keep the game files in order

115
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,720
and maintain an efficient work system in such a complex project.

116
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,220
Many people ask us whether all of The History of Khorinis' team

117
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,040
consists of professionals in the fields of I.T. or electronic entertainment.

118
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,620
So we answer:

119
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,360
not every person in the team is a pro.

120
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,260
The team is much alike the Tower of Babel.

121
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:33,300
The project gathers both the people working as professional graphic designers

122
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,280
and the amateurs that possess skills good enough

123
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,540
to be able to help with the mod.

124
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,380
Professionals are in minority here,

125
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:47,520
and it would be virtually impossible to recruit a non-profit team consisting entirely of professionals.

126
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,420
That’s the case with all the subdivisions of the project.

127
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,160
What is more, it's usually the non-professionals

128
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,800
who can dedicate more free time to the project,

129
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,360
and who allow us to maintain a good work pace.

130
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,800
Working on such a project

131
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,380
is also an awesome opportunity for people

132
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:07,800
who are considering going pro in game development or I.T. industries.

133
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,120
That's how the team members can nicely help one another hone their skills.

134
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,260
You can find all kinds of people in the team:

135
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:18,560
school pupils, students of technical and graphical universities, and professionals.

136
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,980
Additionally, we'd like to point out

137
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,720
that we DO NOT operate as a professional gamedev studio,

138
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,940
nor will we ever be one.

139
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,140
Since we are scattered all over the country, the project is being made online

140
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,660
and cannot be considered a full-time professional job.

141
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:36,520
Like in every company, clashes and disputes sometimes happen.

142
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,440
The difference is that nobody here is paid for their hard work,

143
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,760
and because the project is being made remotely,

144
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,360
we often have to improvise in order to achieve our goals.

145
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,380
Sometimes you need to bend over backwards in order to make things right.

146
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,940
Another phenomenon the team has to cope with

147
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:58,120
is the staff rotation, which hinders the development of many non-profit projects.

148
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,780
Of course, people have their jobs and responsibilities,

149
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,760
which is why sometimes some need to take time off,

150
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,400
and some have to quit the project permanently.

151
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:12,800
When that happens, other people from the team must assume the absentees' responsibilities.

152
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,880
The staff rotation is one of the reasons

153
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,580
why we cannot give you neither exact nor an estimated date of the launch of the mod.

154
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:24,920
Despite having an army of employees working professionally on the game every day,

155
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,280
CD Projekt failed to release The Witcher 3 on time and had a three-month delay.

156
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,660
If even a professional gamedev team can misjudge their possibilities

157
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:36,740
it wouldn't be right to expect precision from us, enthusiasts who work on the project only in their free time.

158
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,480
Of course, the scale of our endeavour isn't quite the same.

159
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,520
The History of Khorinis is not a AAA game with a brand new engine, as is the case with The Witcher.

160
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,560
It’s just an expansion to an already-existing Gothic game,

161
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,960
but the problems we encounter during the process of developing The History of Khorinis

162
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,460
are often more complex than in professional gamedev studios.

163
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,420
We can only count on the time and goodwill of the team members,

164
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,740
who, after all, work for free,

165
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,920
not to mention the issues and limitations of Zengine,

166
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,000
the Gothic game engine, itself.

167
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,660
The whole team's work process is based on reliability and mutual respect,

168
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,100
and we believe that as long as we keep them up,

169
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,780
we will, slowly but surely, reach our main goal.

170
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:20,300
And that's about it as far as The Game Development Division is concerned!

171
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,500
The Video and Dubbing Divisions

172
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,340
We decided to discuss both divisions simultaneously

173
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:32,340
because their cooperation is very close and they are both coordinated by the team leader directly.

174
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,240
Additionally, there are members of the SoulFire team who belong to both divisions at the same time,

175
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,880
namely the sound technicians.

176
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,440
Since we’ve already discussed The Video Division’s tasks in the introduction,

177
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,420
we can only add that it is thanks to their efforts

178
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:49,460
that we managed to form a cooperation with the Ministry of Culture & National Heritage,

179
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:53,520
namely with The Polish National Film Archive and National Audiovisual Institute

180
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,800
within the framework of "The Seniors" project.

181
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,600
The Video Division crew is responsible for getting in touch with actors,

182
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,140
and thanks to them we can work with so many remarkable individuals.

183
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,180
They also show you how work on The History of Khorinis looks like

184
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,640
and produce other audiovisual materials.

185
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,260
The Video and The Dubbing Divisions cooperate closely.

186
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,760
While the first of them conducts the process of voice recording,

187
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,360
the second puts the recorded material together, with each of the sound technicians working individually on their private PC's.

188
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,800
When it comes to dubbing, two important facts need to be mentioned.

189
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,180
First, almost all of the actors involved in the project live in the capital of Poland, Warsaw,

190
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:36,280
therefore about 95% of the recording sessions are held there.

191
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,240
Warsaw is also the place where the recording studio 'Start International Polska' is located.

192
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,500
That’s where the dubbing to Gothic and Gothic II had been recorded.

193
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,100
Small wonder, then, that its cast consisted entirely of the actors living in the area.

194
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,300
Secondly, right now we only record actors that are terminally ill,

195
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,320
at an advanced age, or whose dialogue lines have been completed,

196
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:02,060
which is the case with some of the side characters of the game.

197
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,680
Most of the recording will be done only a few months before the launch of the mod

198
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,160
That primarily concerns main characters, the dialogue lines of which

199
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,800
are still being changed or added.

200
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,560
However, the rehearsals for the role of the game’s protagonist will surely begin much earlier

201
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,080
so that we can select the best actor to voice the character.

202
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,800
We mustn't forget about Kamil Jędrzejewski, our music composer, who too belongs to the sound section of the project.

203
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,220
That’s all we have to say about The Video and The Dubbing Divisions.

204
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,780
The fourth division is formed by people who support the project in many different ways.

205
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:39,000
For example, we administer a separate translating subdivision.

206
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,260
Apart from that, there are people responsible for the e-mail box and Facebook profile, where they reply to your messages.

207
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:51,340
On this occasion, we warmly thank all the people mentioned above for their invaluable aid!

208
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,600
That's all you need to know about our production divisions.

209
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,400
We tried to create the most efficient, and at the same time the least absorbing system of work,

210
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,660
so that we do not waste neither your nor our time.

211
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:07,340
We modestly hope that this movie resolved all your doubts,

212
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,900
at least as far as the general system of work organization in The History of Khorinis is concerned.

213
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,860
With all that said, we want to address

214
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,560
your requests for more information about the plot of The History of Khorinis.

215
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,780
At this stage of production we deliberately avoid giving too many details,

216
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:28,660
which is a standard procedure among the gamedev industries and should not be surprising.

217
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:35,180
Of course, you can expect a teaser or a prologue video soon before the game’s release,

218
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,000
but to make one now would be pointless.

219
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,160
As the best example of when such things should be published serves the game Elex,

220
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,960
where the prologue was presented just a couple of months before the game was released

221
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,940
in order to raise tension among the players in an appropriate moment.

222
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,280
In this matter we are sure to follow in Piranha Bytes’ footsteps.

223
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,980
For now, we ask you for patience,

224
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:01,480
and encourage you to check out a short teaser available on the project’s website.

225
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,980
You can trust us in this matter,

226
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,720
because we have frequently proved

227
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,600
that we take our job very seriously.

228
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:18,800
Finally, we would like to specify what kind of help exactly we need in The History of Khorinis project,

229
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,900
since a lot of people ask about it.

230
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:26,620
As regards recruitment, we are currently in dire need of:

231
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:31,360
Scripters with a good command over DAEDALUS programming language,

232
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,580
which is similar to C++

233
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,780
but still requires specific knowledge and experience.

234
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:42,900
Apart from that, our scripters have to be at least familiar with the Git version control system.

235
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,780
Screenwriters responsible for writing characters and their dialogues.

236
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:52,460
You might feel encouraged by the fact that your dialogues will be read by high-profile actors,

237
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,500
so if you have a creative writing style, we are waiting for your application!

238
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,640
It’s worth it!

239
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,620
Please note that the main plot is already written,

240
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:06,120
and we need help mostly with writing dialogues

241
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,160
for subplots and side quests.

242
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:16,280
3D graphic designers, and at least one 2D graphic designer highly skilled in his craft.

243
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,140
Drafters and concept artists.

244
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,200
Russian and German translators,

245
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,060
so far only to help with translating video materials.

246
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:30,540
Students of philology are welcome, so as people with language certificates

247
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,560
at at least B2 level of language proficiency.

248
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,380
