1
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,960
“The Kingdom of Myrtana, united by king Rhobar II”

2
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,720
Hello!

3
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,120
Arkadiusz “Arkadikuss” Woźniak here!

4
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,380
As you can see I can speak English as well!

5
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,620
We are certainly aware how much challenging for you is watching our materials with Polish voice-over

6
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,220
and with subtitles in your native languages,

7
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,920
so we decided to make a special video material with English voice-over,

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,440
aimed directly to you — the fans of the History of Khorinis

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,260
from abroad and the rest of the world!

10
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,940
As usual we have also prepared you the captions in several lanugages.

11
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,240
In this material we are going to answer all important questions about project,

12
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:11,780
his development and about us — the SoulFire team, which is working on the History of Khorinis.

13
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,260
So, stay a while and enjoy watching!

14
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:20,120
Before we'll get to the questions and answers, let us tell you a few important informations.

15
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,360
At first, we want to thank you for your support.

16
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:28,030
Besides several tens of thousands followers from Poland, a few thousand people from all

17
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,680
over the world are following us on all social media!

18
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,520
You also represent about 20% of viewers on our YouTube channel!

19
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:42,940
We are especially grateful, because you are in fact following a Polish project — which is still ongoing.

20
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,820
It shows not only your devotion to the Gothic saga, but it also means that this game is

21
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,200
unique and still popular among you even the release was a long time ago!

22
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,179
No matter from WHICH country we are!

23
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,120
WE ALL LOVE AND GLORIFY THAT EPIC GERMAN GAME, CALLED GOTHIC!

24
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,720
And this is beatiful!

25
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:09,640
As an additional information you need to know that Gothic game in Poland was sold in total

26
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,140
almost in one million copies, what is INCREDIBLE!

27
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,120
The most numerous group of viewers are of course Germans and Russians,

28
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:26,240
who are to this day gathering on World of Gothic Deutschland, World of Players Russia and RPG Russia respectively.

29
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,920
Next most numerous group are our Serbian and Romanian brothers, who are gathered

30
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,360
at World of Gothic Romania.

31
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:40,800
Another huge groups of viewers are Italians, which community is gathering on Gothic Italia.

32
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,760
People from Spain and their glorious portal called Gothic Clan Espańa, which was created

33
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:54,600
right after the release of Gothic 1 and on which we can find a lot of people from the South America as well.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,840
Next huge group is French,

35
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,400
which they were gathering on portal called Gothic Universe France

36
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,560
and which is nonexistent nowadays.

37
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,480
At this point, we want also to thank you, because in Poland there was a myth that success

38
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,180
of Gothic was minor on the West.

39
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:16,090
Of course it was smaller, however your presence and interest in that project shows how Gothic

40
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,800
even has affected you after ALL THESE years.

41
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,700
Especially people from the Latin-languages countries.

42
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:29,520
Our brothers from Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia, whose their place is Gothicz.net website.

43
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,460
By contrast, less numerous group of the fans, which come from North America and the British Isles,

44
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,000
gather on WorldOfGothic.com website.

45
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,900
Besides, our projects is followed on ModDB.com by people from countries like

46
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,180
Slovenia, Latvia, Morocco, Bulgaria and Colombia.

47
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,660
Best regards!

48
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:57,020
Gothic with full native voice-over was released only in countries such as Germany, Poland,

49
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:01,080
Russia and in the English-speaking countries — USA and the United Kingdom.

50
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,580
As for the rest of you, we admire that the game you were playing with captions in your

51
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,040
languages with English voice-over has brought out so great emotions in you.

52
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,860
You are interested in that game to this day.

53
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,520
From our point of view it is incredible!

54
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:21,440
And last but not least — you need to know, that you, all fans from abroad,

55
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,980
you are for us as IMPORTANT as the fans from Poland.

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,460
We respect you, appreciate you and we love THIS game so much, just like you.

57
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,560
Are you ready?

58
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,100
So let’s begin the Q&A!

59
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,720
What is the History of Khorinis?

60
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:45,560
The History of Khorinis is an independent story, which is a PREQUEL to the Gothic saga.

61
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,660
It tells a story, which had occurred eleven years BEFORE the action from Gothic 1.

62
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,060
A plot of the addon takes place a year before the creation of the Magical Barrier.

63
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,760
Publication of the project is planned in two parts — at first on the new island Vaduz

64
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,420
and next on Khorinis Island.

65
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,220
A new island appears in the addon, because we wanted to show you another part of this

66
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:13,300
glorious Kingdom, and to show you different metropolis than the City of Khorinis.

67
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,600
Besides, this additional island will make our story more interesting,

68
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,640
so it will give you more fun.

69
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:26,180
It is also characterized by professional voice-over in Polish language, in future also in professional

70
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:31,140
English voice-over acting as well, and unusual attention to details.

71
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,320
The History of Khorinis is a non-profit project

72
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,840
and it will be available FOR FREE.

73
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,500
What was the idea for dubbing?

74
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,480
How did you get the actors for this project?

75
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,860
One of the most important things making Gothic unique in Poland was the world-class, wonderful

76
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,860
dubbing, in which we can find many excellent Polish actors.

77
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:58,020
With the fact that the team leader comes from the well-known family of filmmakers, we managed

78
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:03,960
to arrange a contribution of many movies, theatrical and voice-over actors for FREE.

79
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,360
It means that the all the actors and lectors help for free,

80
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,660
including me.

81
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:14,740
Thanks to the kindness of our friends we have also FREE access to the PROFESSIONAL voice-over studios

82
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:20,480
in three big cities: in Warsaw — the capital, Łódź and Wrocław (Breslau).

83
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:26,080
It has allowed us to gather a dream team, because we don’t need to WORRY about any costs.

84
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,960
We encourage some actors individually, showing them the scale of our project, and to honor

85
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,480
them in the series of documentary videos.

86
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,879
Furthermore, every character from Gothic will be cast by the same actor, who dubbed it in

87
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,800
Polish version of the game.

88
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,340
Why have we started to record right now?

89
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:53,500
The most important reason for which we have started recordings is an age and health state of some actors.

90
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:58,160
Priority is given to those actors who are in the advanced age –

91
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,760
those in their 80s and 90s.

92
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,120
Besides, priority is also given to the actors, who are suffering from serious illnesses.

93
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,000
In both cases there is no way to postpone recordings.

94
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:16,500
Another important reason is the fact that both recording studios and most of the actors are helping us for free.

95
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,120
Therefore, WE have to adjust to THEIR free time.

96
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,839
Taking additionally to account the scale of the project, it is important to start the

97
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,020
recordings as soon as possible — and do not left all of them at the last minute.

98
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,719
Furthermore, there is nothing wrong in recording and placing the recordings in the game at

99
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,960
the development stage — the similar way was used in the all parts of the Witcher games.

100
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,940
It allows US — the authors — to see our vision in practice in the game,

101
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:51,580
and it also makes a possibility to show YOU all our effects with full voice and sound effects.

102
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,040
For how many years has the project been in development?

103
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,160
The project in current shape has been in progress from the late 2015.

104
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,220
Its first concept appeared in 2009.

105
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:10,560
At that time it was a COMPLETELY different project, which quality was quite lower than our project nowadays.

106
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:15,560
We are going to prepare a separate video material about its history in the future.

107
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,580
When will the History of Khorinis be released?

108
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,960
Our addon is still at the stage of putting all elements together — we are rewriting

109
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:30,060
scripts into game code, placing the characters, items and quests to the finished world

110
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,880
and adding the voice-overs instantly on the same stage.

111
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:40,420
Besides, we need to make voice-overs for 50 actors and there is a possibility of increasing that number.

112
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:46,580
The problem is that a big company can rent a recording studio and hire actors for a month.

113
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:53,250
So, for us, it is IMPOSSIBLE to estimate the one true release date, because NOBODY can ever made

114
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,620
a project on a big scale in a non-profit way.

115
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:02,160
WE are tailoring to all, who are helping us for free, which we mentioned earlier.

116
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,780
We are not going to say ANY release dates until we're on the final stage of the project.

117
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,440
When will English version of the addon be released?

118
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,480
And how many language versions will be also prepared?

119
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:19,920
Due to the fact that we will be performing changes in our project to the end of development,

120
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:26,940
we decided that it will be better to start translation with the release of the Polish version of the History of Khorinis.

121
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,720
We estimate that the translation into English language will take us about three months.

122
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,900
The work on translation will be both fast and professional.

123
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:41,180
Furthermore, we have got a confirmation from Gothic Italia team that they will take care

124
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:46,000
of the translation into Italian just immediately after the translation into English language.

125
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,810
They are experienced in the translation as well, being responsible for the translation

126
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:56,060
of projects such as Community Story Project or the official patch to Gothic 3.

127
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,660
Our lead programmer — Szymon “Szmyk” Żak — is proficient in Russian language,

128
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,980
so for sure the translation into Russian will move under his leadership.

129
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,080
For obvious reasons, we will be trying to get a help in the translation of the History of Khorinis into German language.

130
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:19,260
Every another language version will be in the hands of fans, their interest and willingness to help.

131
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:25,140
We are also planning to create professional English voice-over acting, because many of our younger

132
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:30,820
actors had great English accent and also a lot of willingness and professionalism

133
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,180
to voice-over this game.

134
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,840
We can confirm four language versions at this very moment:

135
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,900
English, Italian, Russian and German.

136
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,940
How do we know that the Barrier was 10 years old?

137
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,280
In official comic book “Gothic Der Comic” as well as in game manuals associated with

138
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,180
one of Gothic games, the age of the Barrier appears twice.

139
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,420
One states it is 10 years old, other 20.

140
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:04,880
And so we had to make a choice regarding the true age which would best suit the chronology of the games.

141
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,100
In the game itself the age of the Magical Barrier doesn’t appear.

142
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,140
It is only suggested that the Barrier is 10 or 20 years old.

143
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:19,280
Furthermore, twenty-year-old barrier would cause logical and chronological problems.

144
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,160
We will soon prepare a SPECIAL video regarding the true age of the Magical Barrier.

145
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:29,920
The video will include captions in all the languages to give you justification for OUR

146
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,320
choice of the ten-year-old barrier.

147
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,920
Why don’t you make your own game?

148
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,620
Part of the people working at our project

149
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,520
worked or keep working in the biggest Polish and

150
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,300
world companies of video games, electronic or video industry.

151
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:51,700
We are truly aware how much difficult task would be a project of our own game, how much

152
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:57,240
financial expenses would require and how big would be a possibility of its failure.

153
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,000
Therefore we DO NOT have such ambitions in this matter.

154
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,140
Our goal is to honor the climate and the story of the first two Gothic games,

155
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:11,900
and to give a pleasure for hundreds of thousands of fans in Poland and in the world.

156
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:18,220
We all share a serious approach to the tasks carried out in our team, and above all,

157
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,400
a faith in the project and love to the glorious game that Gothic is.

158
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,120
Can we support you somehow?

159
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:32,280
All information and links for donations can be found in the description of that video.

160
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,920
Does Piranha Bytes know about your project?

161
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,640
This question appears very often.

162
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:44,880
We can confirm that the official profile of the Piranha Bytes likes our profile on Facebook,

163
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,760
so it means that they confirm their interest even through official ways.

164
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:54,340
As an additional point, we want to say that the project do not touch the story and places

165
00:12:54,340 --> 00:13:01,620
from Gothic 3, because the whole story of our addon refers only to the canon of Gothic 1 and Gothic 2.

166
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,520
And these were the all answers for your frequently asked questions.

167
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,740
If you want to keep up with this wonderful project, we encourage you

168
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,220
to subscribe our YouTube channel and observe us at official social media!

169
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:22,500
We warmly urge you to share in comments section with your stories and memories about Gothic.

170
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:28,400
We are sure that it will be interesting to all of us, especially Polish fans of Gothic,

171
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,620
who are not exactly aware of the popularity of Gothic in the world.

172
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,500
Surprise us!

173
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:40,320
We have also a big request to you — in order to get to more fans of the Gothic game:

174
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:46,080
Please, inform them about our project in every way, in your own countries!

175
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:52,060
Many thanks to Bartosz Biały for preparing English translation of this video material.

176
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,060
He is responsible for all the current translations as well.

177
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,280
Big thanks for proofreading the German translations goes to Pierre also known as “ThielHater”,

178
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:10,140
who is a big fan of the world of Myrthana as we are, and who has been working on "Gothic Reloaded Mod" for many years.

179
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,520
The goal of this modification is to enhance a graphic details of Gothic 1 to the possible

180
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:22,579
highest level, keeping a 100% of the original atmosphere of the Mine Valley

181
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,180
from 2001 simultaneously.

182
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:34,180
Our cooperation started back in 2010, when Pierre shared his remodeled, detailed model of the Old Camp with us.

183
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,060
The project is currently in the final stages of the development.

184
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,460
Its demo, which includes a playable first chapter, can be downloaded from the official website.

185
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,180
Privately, Pierre works as a professional programmer.

186
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,320
Effects of the work of his team are just awesome!

187
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:55,100
We warmly encourage you to check their project, and thank you, Pierre for all!

188
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,800
Best regards to all Germans.

189
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:19,980
However, the greatest thanks belong here to Jakub Masztakowski & Tomasz Rutkowski, who translated

190
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:24,640
the entire transcription of the Polish language directly into German!

191
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,980
Another thanks for the Russian translation goes to Dmitriy Kovchenko,

192
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:37,220
who was responsible for the translation of the video about Gothic Sequel, and he helps us in running our profile on Russian VKontakte.

193
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,360
Equally also great thanks go to Konstantin “tyson90” Kulichyov and Łukasz Wróbel,

194
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:47,380
who has translated transcription directly from Polish language to Russian!

195
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:53,320
By the way, we invite all fans from VK to observe our profile.

196
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,680
Huge thanks to the team of Gothic Italia for Italian translation.

197
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,420
Guys are making a great job under the leadership of Leonardo.

198
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,120
As we had mentioned before, they are responsible for the translation of the projects such as

199
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:25,200
Community Story Project, Quest Pack or Content Mod into Italian language.

200
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:33,140
They are also responsible for the translation of our all video materials, and also the History of Khorinis in the future.

201
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,300
Besides, they are probably bigger fans of Gothic than we are.

202
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:43,400
The proof of this is the fact that they even translated the documental movie about Andrzej Tomecki,

203
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,240
who was associated with Polish version of the game!

204
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:54,140
Dark — our team leader — visits Italy many times per year, so he invites you for a beer next time!

205
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,320
We owe much to Darchy “Darko” Soyer for Serbian translation.

206
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:12,360
Darko is a gifted graphic designer, who worked on the textures to gigantic Community Story Project for Gothic 3 many years ago.

207
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:18,760
With his translation, our videos can be watched not only by Serbs, but also by all citizens

208
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:24,040
from the former republic of Yugoslavia — Slovenians, Croats and Bosnians.

209
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,560
Our big thanks goes to Filip “tonyskate” Richter for Czech translation,

210
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,100
