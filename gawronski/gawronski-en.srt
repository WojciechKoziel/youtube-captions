1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,340
Stay awhile and listen...

2
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:35,820
Andrzej Gawroński is a man without whom the childhood of many young Poles would not have been the same.

3
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,200
He is an outstanding theatre, movie, and voice actor.

4
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,840
Mr Gawroński voiced an astronomical number of 800 characters,

5
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:51,399
gaining recognition as the leading voice in the history of Polish dubbing.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,579
He was born in 1935, in Warsaw.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,320
His theatre debut took place in 1956,

8
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:08,640
and in 1959 he graduated from The Aleksander Zelwerowicz National Academy of Dramatic Art in Warsaw.

9
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,599
For the following 10 years he acted in the prestigious Ateneum Theatre,

10
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:23,920
and then in the Syrena Theatre, where he performed in nearly 60 plays up until 1987.

11
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:32,000
He also recorded songs along with the Polish singer Barbara Krafftówna.

12
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,120
"In a tram or in a queue"

13
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,140
"If you've got somewhere to sit"

14
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,900
"Don't stare at the window or at the courier"

15
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,320
"Or a line of pretty girls"

16
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,540
"But give up your seat for an old lady, hold her bags"

17
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,300
"Because her legs are weaker than yours"

18
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,200
Mr Gawroński is an expample of a truly fulfilled and versatile actor.

19
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:12,240
He starred in over 70 TV productions, both in the movies and TV series.

20
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:20,040
One of his most iconic performances can be seen in 'I Don't Like Monday,' where he plays the part of a driver named Włodzimierz

21
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,780
- You've picked up a man with a child.

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,260
- No, no, don't deny it. There are witnesses.

23
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,420
- So what?

24
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,020
- You can't help people these days, eh?

25
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,500
- Maybe I'm a kind man.

26
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:35,120
And his part in 'How I Unleashed World War II,' where he features as Helmut,

27
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,520
a Gestapo officer who escorts a notorious fictional Polish soldier, Franciszek Dolas.

28
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,180
- Herr Obersturmführer, sir, over there!

29
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,500
Mr Gawroński has lent his voice to as much as 800 characters in 600 different productions:

30
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:04,400
animated movies, foreign live-action movies, radio plays and computer games.

31
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:13,920
One of his dubbing debuts was playing the role of Marlon Brando in a movie 'The Teahouse of the August Moon' in 1964.

32
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,479
Marlon played Sakini - a Japanese citizen of Okinawa Island.

33
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:25,860
Andrzej Gawroński was the ONLY Polish actor able to imitate Brando’s voice.

34
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,400
- Tutti-frutti.

35
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,940
- Most generous gift from the American sergeant.

36
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,420
- Lovely ladies, kind gentlemen, pleased to introduce myself.

37
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,440
During the production of our documentary, our team leader managed to find

38
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:58,679
the last remaining copy of ‘The Teahouse’ recorded in the Polish language, which was stored in the National Film Archive.

39
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:04,519
That copy was later presented to Mr Gawroński.

40
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,620
- Sakini!

41
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,020
- Sakini!

42
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,260
- Oh, hello, you scared me, boss.

43
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,540
- I'd like to know why after each washing I always have one piece of shorts less!

44
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,100
- Because they get lost, boss!

45
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,660
- Oh, I know that they do!

46
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,320
- But for once I want to know why?!

47
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,300
- Let me explain it, boss...

48
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,560
Amongst his roles in animated series is Flip from 'Maya the Bee':

49
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,960
- Oh, I'm sorry, hello kids.

50
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,920
- As you can see, I'm a grasshopper, and my name is Flip!

51
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,820
Or the unforgettable Grouchy Smurf from 'The Smurfs' cartoon show:

52
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,840
- I hate to get sick!

53
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,420
- I'd hate to know how he feels!

54
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,420
- I hate to pull!

55
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:53,360
Among his most prominent voice-acting roles is the part of Eustace Baggie from 'Courage the Cowardly Dog' series,

56
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,920
- My bones are aching!

57
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,700
- I don't feel like getting mad or angry.

58
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,300
- It's got so bad that I don't even feel like...

59
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,080
KICKING THE STUPID DOG!

60
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,820
or master Oogway from the 'Kung Fu Panda' trillogy:

61
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,700
- You are too concerned with what was and what will be.

62
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,540
- There's a saying:

63
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:23,540
- "Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift."

64
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:30,500
Thousands of Polish gamers associate Mr Gawroński with Deckard Cain,

65
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,960
whom he voiced in Diablo II, Diablo III, and the expansion pack Lord of Destruction.

66
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,860
- You have quite a treasure there in that Horadric Cube.

67
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:50,920
Here, the performance of Mr Gawroński went down as one of the best attepmts in the history of video game localisation.

68
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,460
- Away with you, filth! AWAY!

69
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,700
- I hope this ledge holds us...

70
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:09,360
Another game worth mentioning is Robin Hood: The Legend of Sherwood, in which he took on a role as a venerable nobleman - sir Ranulph:

71
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,700
- Alas! Prince John is a traitor!

72
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,700
- Actually I'm not even surprised...

73
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,680
- It is for quite some time that I have had my doubts about his honesty.

74
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,600
He also voiced the old farmers known for their iconic quote of the game:

75
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,500
- That's Robin!

76
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,600
There were over 30 other games, including Risen 2:

77
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,000
- I have been imprisoned here for the whole eternity.

78
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,580
- I can't die...

79
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,420
- Why so?

80
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,180
- 'Tis a punishment for defying Mara's will.

81
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,880
And The Witcher series:

82
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,760
- Ho, ho, a witcher, ho, ho!

83
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,340
- So there we have it,

84
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,760
two witchers, ho, ho!

85
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,740
- I, Tobias Hoffman, am the village chief.

86
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,380
- Hello, hello, I am Fioravanti, a merchant.

87
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,800
- Pardon my noisiness, but aren't you the one hired to kill Kejran?

88
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,480
- I have enough of this place and I would be glad to hear that the trade blockade is finally over.

89
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:22,480
He also voiced a number of characters in Warcraft 3, Skyrim, The Longest Journey, Dragon Age, and many other games.

90
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:31,119
As a curiosity, it is worth to mention that Mr Andrzej had a brother, Aleksander Gawroński, who was also an actor,

91
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,180
and whose daughter is Agata Gawrońska-Bauman:

92
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,220
- I can't take care of everything and everyone...

93
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,520
What is more, her husband is Adam Bauman:

94
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,600
- My name is Diego.

95
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,660
Both of them are perfectly known to Gothic and The Witcher saga fans.

96
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,480
Therefore, Mr Gawroński is the uncle of Mrs Agata.

97
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:56,259
Today, Mr Andrzej is 82 and still remains professionally active.

98
00:07:56,259 --> 00:08:02,159
His voice can still be heard each Saturday afternoon on the Channel One of the Polish Radio,

99
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:07,500
where he takes part in a very popular radio play called 'Matysiakowie,'

100
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:12,079
which has been broadcast continually since 1956.

101
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:20,680
It was beyond any argument for the team of The History of Khorinis to acknowledge the participation of Mr Gawroński in the project.

102
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,879
My name is Andrzej Gawroński, I am pleased to meet you, especially in a film like this one.

103
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:30,500
I was born in Warsaw, on Górnośląska street, in the Powiśle district,

104
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,159
and it was there where I spent the entire war.

105
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:42,139
When we were forced to flee the city, it turned out that I left the day before the Warsaw Uprising started.

106
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:48,639
Me and my brother, we came back from Świder, we were on a summer camp there.

107
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:56,259
The caretakers decided that we should come back a little earlier because the frontline was very close, a terrible thing was coming.

108
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:01,799
They brought us to Warsaw first, by train

109
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,519
that used to run on Grochowska street.

110
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:08,879
We arrived home in the Powiśle district,

111
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:17,860
We come in and mother says: "Dear God, what are you doing here? I was going to pick you up from summer camp in Świder tomorrow and run away to the countryside!"

112
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:22,399
We replied: "Well, mom, it is how it is." "Thank God, well, it's allright," she said.

113
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:31,600
We packed up quickly, but there was nothing to pack really, some pants, a jacket, some shoes...

114
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:35,079
The next day

115
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,320
we walked practically across Powiśle and through Kierbedź Bridge

116
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:45,760
to the station of that narrow-gauge railway.

117
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,560
There I first saw German troops, that "heroes" in their splendid uniforms.

118
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,560
They were there everyday.

119
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,840
They used to carry a pontoon along Górnośląska Street for their military exercises by the Vistula,

120
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:07,259
and they kept on singing this one song, 'Heili, Hailo' (a German folk song)

121
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:08,879
Interesting...

122
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,899
Later, I saw them on the Kierbiedź Bridge,

123
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,219
when they were fleeing Warsaw, from the Praga district.

124
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,580
To Warsaw they went on peasantlike kibitkas (Russian four-wheel carriages).

125
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:30,980
Those peasant horses

126
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:34,620
were still harnessed up,

127
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:42,639
and they were dragging these small rustic carriages inside of which sat the Germans with rifles and helmets,

128
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:45,319
so very prideful...

129
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:53,800
Mr Gawroński, along with his mother and brother, managed to get from the Powiśle to the Praga district, which was on the Eastern side of the river.

130
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,919
Mr Gawroński's mother correctly predicted that the city would become a site of bloody battles,

131
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:03,859
which was why she decided to stay with her family in the countryside,

132
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:07,279
more precisely in the area around Garwolino and Żelichowo,

133
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,420
southeast of Warsaw.

134
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:16,319
Consequently, the Gawroński family was forced to move towards the galloping frontline,

135
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,840
where the retreating Germans waged bloody battles against the encroaching Red Army.

136
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,039
There, the Russians were closing in on concluding Operation Bagration -

137
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,579
the greatest successful offensive in the history of the Soviet Union,

138
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:33,879
during which the Germans lost almost 700 thousand soldiers.

139
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:38,459
It was there that Andrzej Gawroński came face to face with the frontline.

140
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:44,500
I remembered one scene, which became very important in my life,

141
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,299
because it still haunts me night and day.

142
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:51,679
We reached Pilawa by train.

143
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:59,539
In Pilawa the driver could easily stop the vehicle, as it had just two carts and the engine,

144
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,379
and said: "I'm going to Garwolin to pick up the Germans. You can come with me if you want to."

145
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:10,780
So, we got on the train and went with him,

146
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,019
and arrived in Pilawa,

147
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,639
one station before Garwolin.

148
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,480
We got off the train there.

149
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,779
There was about 10 of us,

150
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:25,399
and we decided to reach Żelechów.

151
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:33,980
We were walking through the fields and meadows, and were often attacked by the German scout plane.

152
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,820
It was a so-called 'Kukuruźnik' (soviet biplane).

153
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:47,240
The plane attacked us about eight times, as adults calculated. It kept on encircling us.

154
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,600
Then we were moving through a Polish village -

155
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,159
I will never forget it.

156
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,900
I've seen many villages - both rich and poor. This one was moderate.

157
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:07,000
On one side there were houses, thatched, not bricked,

158
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,159
on the other there were beautifully sowed farmlands and large poplars.

159
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:19,400
We were walking through this village, all of our ten-people group,

160
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,139
until we spotted a house.

161
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,279
A rustic, whitewashed house,

162
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,200
also thatched.

163
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,840
There was a barn, some chicken coops, a cowshed,

164
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:35,539
and a woman standing there...

165
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,240
She...

166
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,659
She looked miserably...

167
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,440
A woman with a furrow on her face. I don't know how old she was, but

168
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,680
she has probably been through a lot...

169
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:54,620
And she cried and she couldn't speak, as I can't speak right now either,

170
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:01,100
but our people started to ask her why, why she was crying.

171
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,640
Barely speaking,

172
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,180
she muttered that she had had three sons

173
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:16,019
The boys left their cottage and went out on the street.

174
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:20,139
Through the gate they noticed German soldiers, marching,

175
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:23,939
the last ones retreating from the front line.

176
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:28,680
The soldiers approached the gate and entered the yard,

177
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,060
shouting "Come here, you rascals!" The boys hid in the barn,

178
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,059
and those Germans followed them...

179
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:45,480
The only three sons the mother had...

180
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:48,079
were killed right in front of her eyes...

181
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,820
After that, they left to "liberate" Warsaw...

182
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,600
And to Moscow, and God only knows where else...

183
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,920
The mother, all in tears, couldn't say a word, seeing that the last of her sons

184
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,300
was still twitching a bit...

185
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:12,840
She knew she couldn't help him... She couldn't help her youngest child...

186
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,939
That was my way out of Warsaw...

187
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,600
In 1954, as the war and the turbulent times of the Polish People's Republic have come to an end,

188
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:39,600
Mr Gawroński decided to apply for the National Academy of Dramatic Art in Warsaw.

189
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,840
He was admitted by Aleksander Zelwerowicz, the star of the pre-war cinema.

190
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:50,640
He studied along with other famous actors, including Włodzimierz Bednarski and Marian Kociniak.

191
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,520
With the latter he shared not only the bond of friendship, but also a room in the dorm.

192
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,960
I was accepted thanks to an actor from the Ateneum Theatre.

193
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,040
His name was Jurek Felczyński, a very likeable, nice fellow.

194
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,600
He once overheared me singing or reciting something

195
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,520
on the school hallway,

196
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:23,120
and asked his colleague from the declamatory team to get me in.

197
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,480
So I went for my first rehearsal

198
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,320
and they asked me to join them.

199
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,240
Thanks to that, I had a chance to participate in a couple of interesting events,

200
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,240
such as the first Polish declamatory contest

201
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,520
where I was awarded first prize in the youth category.

202
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:53,280
Then there was a second competition in Cracow, where I was ranked as the second.

203
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:59,480
It so happened that the professor of the theatre school

204
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,760
came to the concert in the community centre of Warsaw, on Krakowskie Przedmieście.

205
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,440
where we were performing.

206
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,040
There, I was declaiming 'Jankiel's Concerto,'

207
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,720
which I really like, actually.

208
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,120
I learned it at the primary school but I still remember it well.

209
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:24,880
After the performance, the professor approached me and asked:

210
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:31,200
"What are you doing these days, sir?", "Well, I attend a technical school, sir, major in metal machining."

211
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,160
"And after that?", "Well, I'm not quite sure yet, maybe a theatre school..."

212
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,280
"Sir," he said. He was talking in a very specific way.

213
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,400
"Sir, DO come to the theatre school, please.

214
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,280
To the theatre school, I say, by all means!

215
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:55,440
Please stop by the Academy for a rehearsal,

216
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,720
a committee will interview you and they will tell you what next."

217
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,920
I went there, and there was Zelwerowicz along with some ladies.

218
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Zelwerowicz was the one to interview me.

219
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:12,520
"Come on, sir, make these windows blow out!" he encouraged me.

220
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,320
And so I did. I even sang something for them.

221
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:22,080
"Very good, sir, very good indeed," the professor said after I was done. "So now what, you can apply for the Academy, can't you?"

222
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:29,320
"Well... sir, I'm not so sure I can," I replied. "I've been having some issues with the maths..."

223
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,080
"What sort of issues?!"

224
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,960
"Well, I may have to retake my matura exam, and, uh..."

225
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:43,640
"My good sir! Just tell the examination committee that, like Zelwerowicz,

226
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:49,940
you never did well, cannot do well, and will never do well in maths!"

227
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,280
And that is how I got into acting school.

228
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,540
I graduated in 1959,

229
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:10,000
and in 1960 I returned to the Ateneum Theatre, where I already performed while I was in technical school.

230
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,220
They asked me to perform in 'Panna Maliczewska.'

231
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:19,460
This play had one very pleasant scene in which we were singing and playing the mandolins.

232
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:23,040
So yes, I performed there.

233
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:29,380
I performed in over two hundred plays before being admitted to the acting school.

234
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,440
At the time it was forbidden to do so, but I kept it secret.

235
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:38,460
Even later, when we were on the second and the third year in the Academy, we were forbidden to act in movies.

236
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,320
It was completely prohibited.

237
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,480
- Janek, for God's sake, don't be ridiculous.

238
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,280
- Who's that?

239
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,600
- Who did you bring, you nutcase, huh?

240
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,600
- It's some Italian from the train, he didn't want to return me my...

241
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,760
- For God's sake, some Italian from the train!

242
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,780
- You're going to drive me mad! Just look, she brings an Italian to the den, ha!

243
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,800
- And right before the action launches!

244
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,260
Another time, when we were about to play 'Niech no tylko zakwitną jabłonie,'

245
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,720
I couldn't speak at all, my voice was just... gone.

246
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,140
I dressed up and made a run to the theatre manager.

247
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,940
"Stasiu," I said, "listen, I can’t perform tonight."

248
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,800
"Why, what's wrong?"

249
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,940
"Do you hear my voice? I can only speak like this."

250
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:19,900
"But you have to perform!" he said. "But how? I can barely talk, and I'm expected to be singing for an hour and a half!"

251
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:26,560
"Listen," he replied, "there will be a doctor in the audience. There will be an ambulance. Don’t worry, you can handle it.”

252
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,020
Just imagine

253
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,000
that I decided to take on full responsibility of what was about to happen.

254
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I didn’t know whether or not I would make it to the end of the show.

255
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:43,680
But I sang... for an hour and a half I sang, and we made it.

256
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,140
The play went well, but later I had a different issue to handle.

257
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:56,360
I drove somewhere in the dark and accidently smashed the whole rear of my car.

258
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,500
It was a little Trabant, my first car.

259
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:04,220
I had quite a problem with that car, but it had to be repaired somehow.

260
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,480
I managed to find a gentleman who did car renovations,

261
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:13,260
and he said: "It's alright, sir, I will fix everything.

262
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:22,600
But, if possible, I would like to ask for two, maybe three tickets for your play, for my wife and her sister."

263
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,220
"Fine, I'll do my best," I replied.

264
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,240
So I went to the theatre manager

265
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,700
and I told him: "Sir, there's a man that repaired my car.

266
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:35,360
If it wasn’t for him, I wouldn't have made it to Warsaw. He asked me for some tickets,

267
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,240
and I would like to return the favour..."

268
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:44,720
"Tickets? Where am I supposed to get you tickets from? They have been sold out weeks ago."

269
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,920
That wasn’t very kind of him, and in the end, I didn't manage to get the tickets from him.

270
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,460
But I bought them later from a wheeler-dealer.

271
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,780
- Help!

272
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,740
- He's locked himself inside! He wants to jump out of the window!

273
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:10,260
We went to Germany, to Berlin, to perform 'Jabłonie.'

274
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,120
I happened to have hernia, so I shouldn’t be playing at all,

275
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,300
but Mr Warmiński, the theatre director, wanted me to come anyway.

276
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,780
"Sir, you must perform! You must!," he begged,

277
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,380
and… I went there.

278
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:27,820
So here I am, on the stage with the whole troupe. Every seat is taken.

279
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,520
Suddenly, I can feel my gut coming out.

280
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:38,180
I fly backstage, where the theatre employees are,

281
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:43,880
and I push the thing back. Before the show commanced I put on a special belt to prevent that from happening.

282
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,620
Yet here I am, pushing my bowels in.

283
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:55,400
Here I am, dressed like a gentleman, with a cane in my hand. I push that gut in and the people stare at me.

284
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:03,980
I was trying so hard because I didn’t want to call an ambulance and go to a hospital...

285
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,740
- You were supposed to show me the real airplane!

286
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,020
- Well, see what the children are like these days?

287
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,820
- The Mercedes doesn't impress him anymore, he wants an airplane!

288
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,840
There's an interesting story that happened to me on this movie set.

289
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,060
We were recording live,

290
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:32,720
so later, we had to dub the pictures in the studio.

291
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,480
I played a driver of a black Mercedes,

292
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,500
and Bogusz Bilewski, may he rest in peace, played a driver of the second car.

293
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:48,320
During the sound recording in studio on Chełmska Street,

294
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:54,260
we were recording a scene starring me as the driver,

295
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:04,960
and an elegant man with a luggage, who later turned out to be the executive producer.

296
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,120
And the director said: "Ok gentlemen, let's start...

297
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,940
But... but where is the executive producer?"

298
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,280
"He's absent," someone said. "What do you mean?" demanded the director.

299
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,660
"Was he supposed to come today? Because he didn't."

300
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:21,820
"Dear God, what now? Should we wait? Should we call him to come?"

301
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,700
And I came up with a bit mischievous idea.

302
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:33,260
I said: "Sir, you know what, I can voice both characters, if you don't mind."

303
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,840
"But how, you mean, both of them?"

304
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,140
"That's right, I can do both."

305
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,600
"That's impossible...

306
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,820
But as you wish, let's try it, then."

307
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,600
We tried, and I did it.

308
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:58,740
You can still see this particular scene in the movie.

309
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,480
- It's all for people to enjoy.

310
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,380
- Indeed, life feels good.

311
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,500
- You know, today, despite being a representative of a technical division,

312
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,580
I can feel the beating heart of nature.

313
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,240
- Well said.

314
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,940
- I don't even know how I came up with this.

315
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,360
I have to share one more thing with you,

316
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,500
Mr Lech Czołnowski, who's behind the camera right now,

317
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:24,500
shot 'The Sweet Eyes' 40 years ago.

318
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,460
- She loves me, she loves me not, she loves me, she loves me not.

319
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:36,380
And now his son is shooting a documentary about me.

320
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,380
Greetings, it's a pleasure.

321
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:43,960
- Boy, have you even seen this chest?

322
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,200
- It's been lying there for a good 10 years

323
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,880
and almost got stuck to the floor.

324
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:55,020
Oh, ok, yes, we're already done with this character. Let me take it, then.

325
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,960
And now this one.

326
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:03,740
You have to read well, you have to know what it is that you're reading,

327
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,660
and understand how a character in a movie or a game behaves.

328
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,320
This inculdes gestures, gaze, everything. Whether they cough or not,

329
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,960
whether they feel well or not quite.

330
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,960
You have to feel it, nothing more, nothing less.

331
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,680
I guess I felt it.

332
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:29,540
The first role I had a big problem with was in 'Eroica,' I think.

333
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,660
There, in 'Eroica,'

334
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,200
I played the part of

335
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,840
an insurgent of the Warsaw Uprising.

336
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,320
There was this scene with Mr Edek Dziewoński

337
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,280
that was filmed in a house by a workshop in Mokotów.

338
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:55,320
It was in the area where Mr Wojciech Jaruzelski had lived not so long ago.

339
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,040
The house is still there.

340
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:03,700
Me and Mr Dziewoński were talking at the door,

341
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:10,480
and inside there was a German soldier riding a stationary bike.

342
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,040
He pedaled on and on.

343
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,260
I didn't understand what it was all about,

344
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,360
so I asked: "What is he doing, why is he pedaling so persistently?"

345
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,640
"What do you mean? He's making electricity, of course!"

346
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,760
"How come is he making electricity?"

347
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,120
"Well, he's pedaling, and electricity is made."

348
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,360
"Damn it, lads...

349
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,500
It's a strange world we live in."

350
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,800
"Andrzej G. is asking for a call.

351
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,180
I wish to talk about Marlon B.. It's urgent.

352
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,120
Please treat this message seriously. I am waiting for your answer."

353
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:57,740
Before we got round to dubbing 'The Teahouse of the August Moon' in 64' or 65'

354
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:02,720
a contest was announced in order to select a person who was to voice Brando.

355
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,820
There were some rehearsals.

356
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,180
We didn't know in advance who was to do what.

357
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:18,720
The director called us over, played a part of the movie, and each of us, actors, tried his or her hand in voicing the characters.

358
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,420
By the time I was being rehearsed to voice an equally brilliant actor,

359
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,860
Glenn Ford.

360
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,180
When they offered me the role I denied it. "I will never play this character, no way," I said.

361
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,840
"Ford is a marvellous actor, and I'm a boy who's just graduated from school,

362
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,800
with barely 2 or 3 years' experience in dramatic art.

363
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,660
No way, I won't voice him. I don't want to."

364
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:45,500
The director was annoyed. "Fine, try something else then, will you?"

365
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,340
"You're welcome," I replied.

366
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,800
They changed the reels and played a different movie.

367
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:59,280
It was hard to recognize the actor, because the picture was a bit blurry,

368
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,780
but when I looked closer, I saw that he was Marlon Brando.

369
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:11,240
"Great, they're making fun of me again. I won't play him either," I thought.

370
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:15,700
"Gentlemen," I said out loud, "I'm a young boy, I'm not fit to voice a movie star like this.

371
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,860
You must find someone else..."

372
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:23,760
Then the director got angry and almost forced me to keep going:

373
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:29,080
"Sir, we're PAYING you for the rehearsal!"

374
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,900
"Well, so be it, then...," I finally consented.

375
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:41,400
"Play this fragment a few times. I have to accustom to the role. I'll let you know when I'm ready."

376
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,800
"Fine, here you go."

377
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:49,620
They played the fragment once, twice. They played it on and on, seven times maybe...

378
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,140
When I was ready, I said: "Okay, we can record it now."

379
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,440
"Let's do it, then!" the director agreed.

380
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:04,700
So we started the recording process. It wasn't long before I noticed a stir between the director and the soundman.

381
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,400
"Please, keep going, don't stop," they encouraged me.

382
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,460
I was reluctant to continue. "You see that there was another stir," I argued.

383
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,000
"No sir, please, keep recording, everything's fine."

384
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,800
I had a few more tries.

385
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,380
"So what do you think about it?" I asked as we finished.

386
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:24,880
"It went really well, sir! We've searched across the country for a proper actor to voice this part..."

387
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,740
I will not go into details.

388
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:33,740
"Thank you, you've done great. Please, wait for a phone call from Łódź."

389
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,160
So I waited two weeks for that call,

390
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,240
and when I came to Łódź

391
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,380
a secretary told me:

392
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,980
"Sir, the role is yours."

393
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:52,240
When I asked her about my colleague who also tried to get that role, she said:

394
00:30:52,380 --> 00:31:00,220
"Oh, he couldn't hold his nerves. He called me and I told him that, unfortunately, the role was given to Mr Andrzej Gawroński."

395
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,900
"Thank you very much."

396
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,020
- But there's still work to be done...

397
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,260
- If these translations are correct...

398
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:15,360
- The powers of Hell could already be on their way.

399
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,920
I also voiced Kirk Douglas in the movie 'There Was a Crooked Man....'

400
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:25,300
I went to the USA with the crew of the Syrena Theatre,

401
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:31,240
and since the rehearsals were over, I did not suppose that I would be getting any role in that movie.

402
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:37,640
When I came back two weeks later, I was spotted by a friend of mine, who was waiting for her husband at the station.

403
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:44,180
"Andrzej, it's good you're here!" she exclaimed. "The people in the studio have been waiting for you for two weeks!"

404
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,400
"Waiting for me? Why?" I asked. "So that you can start to dub, of course!"

405
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,220
"Dub whom?", "Well, you were chosen to voice Kirk Douglas."

406
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,020
"I was?!

407
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,800
Unbelieveable..."

408
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:56,280
So the next day I came to the studio,

409
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,700
and we started recording.

410
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,900
Kirk Douglas visited Poland twice.

411
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,280
During his second visit, he had an opportunity to meet Mr Gawroński in person

412
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,280
in the actor club in Warsaw.

413
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,020
- I wish that I could speak Polish.

414
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,420
- He wishes that he could speak English...

415
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,460
- POLISH!!!

416
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,320
- Polish, <po polsku>.

417
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,400
- <Rozumie po polsku?> (Do you understand Polish?)

418
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:32,140
I had a chance to meet Mr Douglas in our club.

419
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:39,020
I introduced myself and explained who I was. He was very surprised, but he thanked me really nicely.

420
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,660
I'm sure you were. You always are.

421
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,440
He rises to the occasion. Put a camera in front of him, he's ready to go.

422
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,140
- Eustace...

423
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,840
Do you think that I eat too much?

424
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,960
- Ehh, stupid woman.

425
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,840
- I know everything.

426
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,280
The proposition to voice Eustace came out unexpectedly.

427
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,380
I can't quite recall what he used to call his dog...

428
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,400
He yelled at him in English...

429
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,440
stupid dog!

430
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,800
- Right, stupid dog!

431
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,800
"Stupid dog!" Yes!

432
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,680
In fact, it was hard work voicing that cartoon.

433
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:26,640
There was a lot going on there, and the pace was fast, too.

434
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,720
It was very demanding.

435
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:42,520
"Far, very far from here, some two thousand miles away,

436
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,380
That's where they live, and work, and play!

437
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:49,940
Being a Smurf is good, so that's why we sing all day.

438
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:53,520
We're doing things the Smurfy way!"

439
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,060
When I voiced the Smurf... ummm...

440
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,940
the one that always hated everything,

441
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,740
in the TV show...

442
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:09,260
what was his name... Grouchy? Yes! The Grouchy Smurf!

443
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:18,000
That was in the animated show, and when 'The Smurfs' hit the theaters, I voiced Papa Smurf there.

444
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,920
'The Smurfs'

445
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,880
The video games are especially interesting for the young people.

446
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,840
However, unlike films, video games, with all their devils and spectres,

447
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,280
only require voice acting.

448
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,760
I can speak in both high-pitched and low-pitched voice,

449
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,160
or a guttural one.

450
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:46,100
The voice actor must know how to tackle all sorts of different roles.

451
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,100
And let me tell you that

452
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,980
I did a lot of voice acting in video games.

453
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:55,840
When we were meeting in the recording studio,

454
00:34:56,180 --> 00:35:00,980
sometimes five, six, or seven of us used the same microphone at the same time.

455
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,980
In those days we all used the same microphone.

456
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,420
Whenever there were errors, or disagreements between people,

457
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,420
everything had to be re-recorded from scratch.

458
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,480
Nowadays, things are a lot more convenient.

459
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,400
Even though there is a single microphone, there is also just a single actor at it.

460
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,080
He does all the voice acting himself and he's responsible for himself only.

461
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,320
If he makes an error, he needs to record the line again, too,

462
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,720
only today it's all on him whether he gets it right.

463
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,440
The work is much easier than before.

464
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,720
It's all peace and quiet, recording goes faster.

465
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,640
It's the same job, yet at some points it feels different.

466
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,600
- I can't keep up with them anymore,

467
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,660
damned vermin!

468
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,760
- Of course, forget it.

469
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,240
I can only say that nowadays I'm working less and less, and probably rightly so!

470
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,760
I did my share of recording. I did my job.

471
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,100
There's one more thing I want to boast about.

472
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,200
To work with such a team

473
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,840
at my age, after all these years,

474
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,320
it's a revelation. It's an amazing thing!

475
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,540
These young people, know everything about 'The Teahouse of the August Moon,'

476
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,920
more than me, actually. I'm speechless.

477
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,020
And I am glad, I enjoy working with you!

478
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,420
I send my best regards to all the fans,

479
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,500
